### Executive Summary

##### The Crypto Market Intelligence MCP project demonstrates how modern Artificial Intelligence systems can interact with enterprise data platforms using the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Instead of storing data inside the AI model itself, the model dynamically retrieves live information from a Databricks SQL Warehouse through reusable Python tools.

##### This project combines several technologies that are commonly used in production environments, including Python, Databricks, SQL, REST APIs, FastMCP, Claude Desktop, automated testing with Pytest, structured logging, and environment-based configuration management.

##### Rather than functioning as a simple chatbot, the application behaves as an intelligent business analyst capable of answering cryptocurrency market questions using live data.

---

### Project Overview

##### Cryptocurrency markets generate enormous amounts of information every second. Investors, analysts, and financial institutions often need immediate answers to questions such as:

- What is the current market capitalization?
- Which cryptocurrencies gained the most today?
- Which cryptocurrencies lost the most today?
- Which assets have the highest trading volume?
- Which cryptocurrencies dominate the market?

##### Traditionally, answering these questions requires manually opening multiple dashboards or writing SQL queries.

##### This project removes that complexity by allowing Claude Desktop to ask these questions in natural language while the MCP server retrieves the answers directly from Databricks.

---

### Business Problem

##### Modern businesses generate huge amounts of structured data. Unfortunately, most decision-makers cannot write SQL queries or understand database schemas.

##### This creates a gap between business users and technical systems.

##### A business executive may simply ask:

> "Show me today's top gaining cryptocurrencies."

##### However, the underlying database requires a complex SQL query to answer that question.

##### Without an intelligent interface, valuable business information remains difficult to access.

---

### Proposed Solution

##### The Model Context Protocol provides a bridge between Large Language Models and external systems.

##### Instead of memorizing information, the AI dynamically retrieves fresh data whenever a user asks a question.

##### In this project:

1. Claude Desktop receives a user's question.
2. Claude identifies which MCP tool should answer the request.
3. The MCP server executes the corresponding Python function.
4. Python loads a SQL query from the queries folder.
5. The SQL query is sent to Databricks SQL Warehouse.
6. Databricks executes the query against Gold Layer tables.
7. Results are returned to Claude.
8. Claude formats the response into natural language.

##### This architecture separates responsibilities cleanly while ensuring responses are always based on current data.

### What's Next

##### In the next section of this README, we will explore the complete technology stack used in this project. Rather than simply listing programming languages and tools, we will explain why each technology was selected, what role it plays in the architecture, and how it contributes to building a production-ready AI application.

##### Understanding the reasoning behind each technology is just as important as learning how to use it. This knowledge will help you explain your design decisions confidently during interviews and when discussing the project with clients or colleagues.
